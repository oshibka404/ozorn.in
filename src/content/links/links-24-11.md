## Algorithms

- [Analytical anti-aliasing](https://blog.frost.kiwi/analytical-anti-aliasing/) by FrostKiwi, on different approaches to the smooth rendering of shape edges, with live demos of every one of them. 

### CRDT

- [Nice articles on CRDT algorithms](https://madebyevan.com/algos/) with demos, written by Figma co-founder Evan Wallace.
- [5000x optimization of one CRDT algorithm](https://josephg.com/blog/crdts-go-brrr/), was very useful for understanding what CRDT is.

## Debugging

- [The scientific method of troubleshooting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9YZXuUjyOs) â€” a talk from 10 years ago on debugging as a scientific research process.
