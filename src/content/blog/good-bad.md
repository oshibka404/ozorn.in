If we go one step further, the "Less is more" is a value statement, and it has a more fundamental implication ‚Äì quality exists. As in, there is an ultimately important value that you should pursue by reducing quantity of something that the word "less" refers to. Let's call this value "quality".

Bricks, pencils, avocados, websites, ideas, books, houses, schools, businesses, cities, and people can be good and bad. If we accept that they can be improved; if they can objectively become better and worse, we should accept that there are degrees to their absolute level of quality. In other worse, they can be good and bad, if these words mean anything at all (they do).

## Complex things can be good and bad too

There is good and bad art, it's not all relative. A painter can spend months improving details on their painting before they consider it done, and the painting is changing in the direction from "bad art" towards "good art". Artists spend years developing ideas, sharpening their craft, learning techniques and means to express their feelings and ideas, to learn to move their works as far as they can towards what they see a "good art". If there were no good art, if it all was just a matter of personal taste, the artist could just equally roughly outline the first idea they have and expect the same effect from their work. Some do that, and we call it bad art.

Now, juicier questions. Are there good and bad people? What about religions? Nations? Genders? Cultures? I don't know, it feels kinda wrong to think this way. But can we accept that, say, a group called "white men" can improve? I believe so. I even think that we as a society can broadly agree on the desired directions of the change in most of the meaningful dimensions. So, the quality exists even in such big and complex things as large groups of people.

Can we reliably find out if a group has become better or worse over time? I doubt it. Humans are too multi-faceted for that, and we constantly change in many directions, willingly and unwillingly. Neither can we meaningfully compare two nationalities, nor say whether women are objectively better than men. Well, maybe you could, but why would you want to do that? What's wrong with you, psycho?

Nevertheless, even if absolute values of the quality are unclear, potential improvements are usually obvious if you know the subject well enough.

## "Good" is not just "good for me"

We all get rightfully upset when someone imposes a value judgement on an enormously complex entity like "race" or "religion". Most of the time these statements are results of ignorance and oversimplification, so most of the time we dismiss them, and most of the time we are right in doing so. Still, I believe that we can become better as individuals, as groups, and as a society.

Some people argue that there is no "good", there's only "good for me" or "good for us". I reject this notion, or, rather, I want to highlight that the definition of "us" can be extended to "everyone". Intersubjective reality exists on all scales, including the humanity at large.

Telling apart good bananas from bad is easy, and a good person from bad person is hard. But there are better and worse people, otherwise there wouldn't be such thing as "improvement". We may admit that the universal quality is hard to measure and impossible to define, but we shouldn't deny its existence only because of that.

Less is less, and more is more, but sometimes less is better
