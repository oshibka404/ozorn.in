If I had to describe the core of the Western culture in three words, I would say "More is better". More money and power; more friends and sexual partners; more information, more attention; more life experiences and achievements. I usually like to vocally reject it, but I often catch myself living these values without noticing. I'm afraid that trying to escape them would be more or less escaping myself.

Then there's the catchy principle of "Less is more" promoting minimalism. Funny thing is, when you use "Less is more" to say "Less is better" and the listener understands what you mean, then the implied common background is that "more is better", otherwise the phrase would be complete nonsense. No wonder the "Less is more" principle has been so effective in selling more minimalist designs ‚Äì you say "Less is more", and I hear "I should get more of the 'less' in my life".

## There are good and bad

If we go one step further, the "Less is more" is a value statement, and it has a more fundamental implication ‚Äì quality exists. As in, there is an ultimately important value that you should pursue by reducing quantity of something that the word "less" refers to. Let's call this value "quality".

Bricks, pencils, avocados, websites, ideas, books, houses, schools, businesses, cities, and people can be good and bad. If we accept that they can be improved; if they can objectively become better and worse, we should accept that there are degrees to their absolute level of quality. In other worse, they can be good and bad, if these words mean anything at all (they do).

## Complex things can be good and bad too

There is good and bad art, it's not all relative. A painter can spend months improving details on their painting before they consider it done. They spend years developing craft, learning techniques and means to express their feelings and ideas. If there were no good art, if it all was just a matter of subjective taste, the artist could just roughly outline an idea and write prompt and expect the same effect from their work. It doesn't work this way. Still, some do that. I call it bad art.

Now, juicier questions. Are there good and bad religions? What about nations, genders, cultures? My answer is yes. I know, I know, but hear me out. Can we accept that, say, a group called "white men" can become better than it is now? I believe so. I even think that we as a society can broadly agree on the desired directions of the change in most of the meaningful dimensions.

Can we reliably find out if the group has become better or worse over time? I don't think so. Humans are too multi-faceted for that. Neither can we meaningfully compare two nationalities, nor say whether women are objectively better than men. Well, maybe if you really wanted then you could, but why would you want to do that? What's wrong with you, psycho? Nevertheless, even if absolute values of the quality are obscured, the direction of potential improvement is usually clear if you know a subject well enough.

## "Good" is not the same as "good for me"

We all get rightfully upset when someone imposes a value judgement on an enormously complex entity like "race" or "religion". Most of the time these statements are results of ignorance and oversimplification, so most of the time we dismiss them, and most of the time we are right in doing so. Still, I believe that we can become better as individuals, as groups, and as a whole, which means that . 

There can be no "good", there's only "good for me". I reject that denies the possibility.

Telling apart good bananas from bad is easy, and a good person from bad person is trickier. Trying to define a good person or good art usually ends up being a version of "it is someone I like", or relativization. But there are better and worse people . We may admit that the universal quality is hard to measure and impossible to define, but we shouldn't deny its existence only because of that.
