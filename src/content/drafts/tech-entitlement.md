I used to work in a tech company with an office split between two buildings across the street from each other. Both buildings had a coffee bar with free specialty coffee on the ground floor, and my teammates liked coffee in the other building slightly better, so, during lunch, we were walking to the other side of the road. My colleague once said: "It is humiliating that I have to cross the street to have a good coffee". Now, if you don't work in IT or finance, you might think I'm making it up but, shit, the hedonist treadmill is real. We, people, adjust our baseline without noticing, and what looked good yesterday starts looking barely satisfying once it becomes readily available. This [sentiment of entitlement](https://medium.com/@k.kozmana/techtitlement-f2637d9d6b0b) is even worse in big tech.
