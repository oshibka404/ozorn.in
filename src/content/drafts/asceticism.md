Every major school of thought from Buddhism to Communism has some form of asceticism involved. The idea of dismissing real pleasure in favour of an abstract virtue is so ubiquitous that it's shared by Jesus, Greta Thunberg, Ayn Rand, Marie Kondo and that guy who advised to stop buying avocado toasts to afford a house.

First, [creative refusal of reasonable things](/blog/you-resist) is what makes things stand out, which makes previous paragraph almost tautological. We wouldn't be talking about any of the above as separate lines of thoughts if they weren't advocating dismissing various good things.

Second, hedonism, as opposed to asceticism, is inherently self-contradictory and can't form a solid system of values. Like, spend your teen years smoking weed and slacking at school in a company of fellow pleasure-seekers, and live the rest of your life suffering from preventable health problems you can't solve, have low income due to lack of skills and interests deprived of other hedonistic pleasures you learn to desire. If you want to maximize amount of joy you get throughout your life, you have to train resistance to momentary desires. A long-term hedonist should master askesis.

Third, hedonistic treadmill is real. Human brains are exceptional at adjusting happiness baseline. To bring joy, your next experience has to be more exciting than previous one. A meal tastes good when you're hungry. Lying down on a bed feels better after a long run than after three hours of Netflix. Mastering askesis makes you happier even in the short run.

I've never had an account on TikTok or SnapChat, but I used to consistently spend on average two hours a day on Instagram and another two on YouTube, which is miserable if you account for time you sleep and time you work. Essentially, half of my spare time was spent consuming content, not leaving much time to properly digest what I consumed. However, I don't even really want to have had properly digested that. I know people who do much worse.

It was not all wasted time. I learned to make music on YouTube and lectures. Even the entertaining videos I watched were not all bad. Still, the brain damage I was getting was not worth it. I wish I spent that time reading, writing, making music, doing sports or talking to people. Speaking of talking to people, I feel like it becomes increasingly hard to talk about anything deeper than list of groceries, because people have unlearned to listen.

Time on Instagram is hard to justify.

People like to go on a digital detox for a week with an intention to eventually go back to binge-scrolling happy selfies.

A late derivative form of hedonism called consumerism logically leads to the same dead end. As a citizen of consumerist society, you are supposed to care about value you get from consuming goods without giving much thought to environmental impact of the production and working conditions in the supply chain. You are supposed to not care and have few means to know how the money you are giving are being distributed between producers, logistics and intermediaries. Essentially, you are supposed to mentally separate your identity as a consumer from both yourself as a producer and yourself as a form of life on the planet.

Everyone is involved in both production and consumption to some degree, be it directly or through directing flows of money and goods. The more and better you produce, the more and better you afford. This is how capitalism is supposed to work.

Sport. Bouldering where I don't have a phone with me, so I can focus on what matters in the moment, and keep doing it for three hours straight.

Investment and money saving can be seen a form of asceticism. You don't take debt to buy that Tesla you can't afford. You resist you consumer impulse and buy TSLA stocks, so that in a couple of years you can buy the Tesla and a few more promising stocks.
